# WireGuard Configuration Template
#
# This is an example WireGuard configuration file for custom VPN providers.
# To use this:
# 1. Copy this file: cp wg0.conf.example wg0.conf
# 2. Fill in your VPN provider's details below
# 3. Set VPN_PROVIDER=custom and VPN_TYPE=wireguard in .env
#
# For Mullvad, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and other supported providers,
# you don't need this file - just configure the .env file.

[Interface]
# Your WireGuard private key (keep this secret!)
# Get this from your VPN provider's dashboard
PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Your assigned IP addresses (IPv4 and optionally IPv6)
# Example: 10.68.45.123/32, fc00:bbbb:bbbb:bb01::4:2d7a/128
Address = YOUR_IPV4_ADDRESS/32, YOUR_IPV6_ADDRESS/128

# DNS servers (optional, Gluetun handles DNS with DoT by default)
# Example: DNS = 10.64.0.1
# DNS = 10.64.0.1

[Peer]
# VPN server's public key
# Get this from your VPN provider
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE

# Allowed IPs (usually 0.0.0.0/0 for all IPv4 and ::0/0 for all IPv6)
# This routes all traffic through the VPN
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::0/0

# VPN server endpoint (IP:PORT)
# Example: Endpoint = 123.45.67.89:51820
Endpoint = SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT

# Persistent keepalive (optional, recommended for NAT traversal)
# Sends keepalive packets every 25 seconds
PersistentKeepalive = 25

# Notes
# =================================================================
# - Keep your private key secret! Never commit it to version control.
# - The .gitignore file is configured to exclude all .conf files
#   (except .example files) to prevent accidental commits.
# - For better security, use the built-in provider support when available.
# - WireGuard is generally faster and more secure than OpenVPN.
